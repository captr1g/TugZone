TugZone is a gamified token launchpad where two tokens battle for liquidity in time-based "Wars." Users pick a side, buy tokens, and the one with the highest sales wins. No selling during the war â€” only strategy, hype, and pure token warfare. After the war, the winning token hits the DEX.

Launch your token. Join the fight.
Two tokens. One winner. Welcome to TugZone.
